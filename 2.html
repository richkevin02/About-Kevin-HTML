    <h2>Then, what do I want to be?</h2>
    <p>Well, I was a kid who had a lot of dreams. For example, I fell into the fashion industry and wanted to be a <strong>fashion designer as well,</strong> so I learned how to use the sawing machine to make my own clothes. However, when I turned in 18, I gave up to be a Fashion designer, because I wasn't sure that I can live well as a fashion designer. I got passionate, but it wasn't enough to follow my dreams through numerous difficulties.</p>
    <p>After that situation, I changed my dreams just like the previous one and it was really hard to decide <strong>single job</strong> for me, so I reach the compromise to be a web developer. at least, I can do the <strong>designer's and developer's works</strong> at the same time.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, I'm still interesting of <strong>fashion industries</strong> and if I have time after I became <u>a web developer,</u> then I would like to run <strong>my own business</strong> of fashion brand. Well, <strong>Virgil Abloh</strong> who is a fashion director of Louis Vuitton and runs his own business named Off-white was architecture as well. So... I think there is no <strong>limit</strong> to having various jobs.</p>
