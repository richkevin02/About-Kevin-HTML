    <p>Welcome to this page for <strong>Kevin!</strong> This page introduces Kevin who made this page. I made this to study computer languages(HTML, CSS). Before you look at this website,  I want you to know that I'll be in Canada as a University student in this(2023) September and my major is <strong>Computer Science.</strong></p> 
    <p>I don't think someone will see this page except my friends or the person around me, but if you are a person who I don't know and seeing this, then <strong>I appreciate seeing this page</strong> that I made. Besides, if you have any questions or advice, then please contact me at the <strong>email</strong> below. <br><u>kevintoron02@naver.com</u></p>
