    <h2>To end of intorducing myself.</h2>
    <p>Well,, this is the last page about <strong>me.</strong> While I making this, I really enjoyed to <u>recall my past and making this web site.</u> And it made me to think about my future again and be more firm about my thoughts. / Now, I can be more sure about where I am heading to, and It actually help me a lot. I am still kind of afraid of going back to Canada, even though I was born in Canada and graduated the high school in Canada as well. But, It has changed to look forward to study there while I'm making this. And I already made a friend who is going to canada at the same time with me from Korea. (I'll bring her to tour Vancouver, because it is her first time in Vancouver.)<u>(I think I didn't made a website, but my diary)</u> So, <strong>thank you</strong> for read this unuseful website in your life and I'll wait for <strong>your respond email.</strong></p>
