    <h2>Who is <a href=" https://www.instagram.com/noonnofus/" target="_blank" title="Kevin's Instagrma"></a>Kevin?</a></h2>
    <p><strong>I</strong> am a person who born in <u>Nov, 30th, 2002 in Ontario, Canada.</u> Furthermore, I and my family came back to Korea and I started to learn Korean at the same time because I had no idea of the Korean language and I used only English with my parents when I was in Canada.
    <br>I adjusted to Korea pretty well, but after I <u>graduated middle school in Korea</u>, I decided to <u>go back to Canada</u> for my future.

    <p>Back to the time when I was there as a high school student, I experienced a lot of things such as <strong> the difference in culture between Korea and Canada, and people. </strong>
    <br>Three years after graduating high school in Canada, I returned to Korea. It was really hard to stay there, but I have changed a lot in a positive way, hence I am able to plan my life and get numerous dreams. 
    <br>Besides, I applied to College that is famous for Computer Science in Canada, because I want to be a <strong>web developer.</strong></p>
